<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Nicholas Lopez, everyone just calls me, Nick. I'm currently in
  college working on my bachelors degree in computer science. I hope to find an
  online internship in the next month or two while continuing my education.

  I enjoy working out five or six days a week in the early morning, which helps
  keep me focused while in my lectures. I prefer strength training and power
  lifting over body building. I want to continue being physically healthy and
  mentally healthy knowing that my field of work will entail a lot of sitting in
  front of a computer.
